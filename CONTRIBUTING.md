## Creating Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request, it will be checked by our Continuous Integration (CI) system to ensure code quality and functionality. To facilitate a smooth review process, contributors must adhere to clean code principles and use tools like linters (fmperf supports black) before committing their changes. This practice helps catch potential issues early, maintains code consistency, and enhances readability, making it easier for others to review and collaborate on the project. Ensuring your code passes linting and other automated checks will expedite the integration of your contributions into the main codebase.
